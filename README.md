# Bias Sorter

## What is this project?
This project is a website where fans of K-Pop can visually sort all of their biases into categories. 

## What is a 'bias'?
A bias in K-Pop is a fan's favorite member(s) within a group. Often, fans will categorize their biases among all of the groups they like. Typically the categories will be "Ults", "Semi-Ult", and "Regular". An "ult bias", short for "ultimate bias", is the person/people that are the fan's most favorite amongst all of their biases. "Semi-ult" is a step down from this and "regular" is all of the other people this fan likes.
